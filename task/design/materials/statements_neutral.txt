I like foot massages
I like free stuff
I like hip-hop music
I like people who litter
I like smelling markers
I like televised sports
I like the way I look
I like to burp out loud
I like to chew my pencil
I like to play cards
I like to read books
I like to sleep in late
I like to watch cartoons
I like to wrestle
I like watching sunsets
I like wearing hoodies
I love ketchup
I love pepperoni pizza
I love scary movies
I make my own lunch
I make people laugh
I never break the rules
I never get bored
I never make my bed
I never sit up straight
I rarely get headaches
I read a lot of comics
I remember dreams
I shower in the morning
I sing in the shower
I sleep without a pillow
I take a lot of naps
I tell a lot of jokes
I think eggs are nasty
I think sushi is gross
I think tattoos are cool
I usually skip breakfast
I want super powers
I want super powers
I want to learn to surf
I wash my hands often
I am afraid of ghosts
