I always have chapstick
I always stay up late
I always use sunscreen
I always watch the news
I always wear a watch
I am a good dancer
I am a morning person
I bite my fingernails
I can keep a secret
I can use chopsticks
I carry a water bottle
I check Facebook often
I daydream in class
I do not eat meat
I hate big cities
I hate earmuffs
I hate tapioca
I hate tofu
I drink a lot of coffee
I floss every day
I get good grades
I get ready quickly
I get sleepy after eating
I hate being late
I hate being sick
I hate chicken soup
I hate doing dishes
I hate eating leftovers
I hate licking envelopes
I hate mosquito bites
I hate pulling weeds
I hate rainy days
I hate riding the bus
I hate skinny jeans
I hate soft beds
I hate sour pickles
I hate spicy mustard
I hate squeaky shoes
I hate to be tickled
I hate to wait in line
I hate walking uphill
I eat potatoes
