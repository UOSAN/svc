A growing body of work has begun to characterize common neural substrates recruited across tasks tapping into processes related to self and reward (Northoff, 2011). We know that the computation of value for primary rewards like food, secondary reinforcers like money and even highly abstract and contextualized forms of value such as prospective social approval have all been linked to activity in the ventral striatum (vS), perhaps the single anatomical region most canonically regarded as “reward-related” (Izuma, Saito, & Sadato, 2008). Some researchers have gone so far as to ask whether the self is, in fact, nothing but reward (Northoff & Hayes, 2011). The goals of this dissertation are to i) outline a conceptual framework that describes how theoretical and neurobiological similarities between self and reward can and should be used to enhance the study of adolescent development, and ii) conduct an fMRI study that characterizes self-reward associations across social contexts. The first goal will be accomplished in the form of a review paper (currently in progress, and invited at Developmental Cognitive Neuroscience). The fMRI study designed to achieve the second goal is described in more detail below.    
###I. Conceptual Framework: The Rewarding Prospect of Becoming Oneself  

In the seminal text on the study of adolescence, G.S. Hall described that oft-maligned epoch as one in which:
*“Sensations are more objectified and their pleasure and their pain effects are more keenly felt. There is a new sense esthetic or enjoyment of sensation itself for its own sake”* (Arnett, 2006).  

It is a testament to his prescience that Hall’s interests in relationships between adolescent reward processing and the emerging adult self are vibrantly reflected in the contemporary scientific literature. While there is much debate about how best to characterize these changes in the growing brain, most developmental neuroscientists can agree that, across species, adolescence is associated with drastic changes in the neural machinery underlying both reward-related computations (Spear, 2004) and self-relevant cognition (Pfeifer & Peake, 2012). Although vS is often associated with reward, recent neuroimaging evidence suggest that, for adolescents, vS is also sensitive to social context for self-relevant stimuli (Jankowski, Moore, Merchant, Kahn, & Pfeifer, 2014). The very definition of reward, in fact, is often framed in terms of the self-reinforcing nature of a stimulus (Montague, King-Casas, & Cohen, 2006).  

Such an approach is difficult to reconcile with dual-systems models of adolescent development, which place the vS in opposition to prefrontal regions implicated in self-relevant processes (e.g., medial prefrontal cortex, mPFC). Recent neuroimaging evidence calls into question the assumptions that activity in subcortical regions is a neural liability and that the role of prefrontal cortex is necessarily protective (Pfeifer & Allen, 2012). If the study of adolescence is to progress the beyond the ‘bad striatum / good cortex’ account of teenagers’ decision-making, we need carefully designed experiments that can test the computations mutually underlying self and reward, as well as the extent to which they are modulated by social context.   

fMRI Study: Neural Basis of the Differential Value of Self-Disclosure
One particularly strong piece of empirical evidence for the relationship between self and reward comes from a suite of experiments that show that people value self-disclosure (Tamir & Mitchell, 2012). Using fMRI, the authors showed that self-specific stimuli elicited stronger responses in the vS than other-specific or non-social stimuli. This finding was complemented by behavioral results demonstrating that participants are willing to forgo monetary rewards in order to share information about themselves, based on the computation of a point of subjective equivalence (PSE), or dollar amount at which participants would electively self-disclose in spite of financial loss. The authors interpreted these findings as evidence that thinking about oneself in private and sharing information about the self with others are independent factors motivating self-disclosure.  

Just as there is no self in a vacuum (Mussweiler 2003), however, the neural mechanisms mutually underlying self-relevant cognition and reward-related processing seem unlikely to be insensitive to social contextual factors. By varying the targets of self-disclosure, we can calculate unique points of subjective equivalence for distinct social contexts, i.e., PSE for keeping a fact private vs. sharing with a parent (1), sharing with a friend (2) or between sharing with a friend vs. with a parent [3] Behavioral evidence from our lab suggests that the PSE for (1) differs from (2)(Mobasser et al., in preparation), but no neuroimaging investigation has yet sought to map the computation of self-disclosure value across distinct social contexts. By using a two-phase experimental paradigm, we will attempt to characterize neural activity associated not only with making targeted (or private) self disclosure statements, but also with the decision to disclose across different social contexts.   

**Hypothesis 1: If the intrinsic value assigned to sharing about oneself with a peer is equivalent to that for sharing about oneself with a parent, then we would expect no differences in the dollar amount associated with the PSE for (share w/ friend vs. keep it private) and (share w/ parent vs. keep it private), or in the striatal BOLD signal associated with disclosures across different social targets.** However, if the value associated with self disclosure does vary based on to whom the self is disclosed, then we should be able to calculate distinct points of subjective equivalence for private vs. friend, private vs. parent, and friend vs. parent conditions. Using the fMRI paradigm further described in Figure 1, we intend to test this hypothesis in a sample of 30 first-year college students.  

Previous work in our laboratory has shown that comparative social judgments between the self and similar others are associated with a unique profile of activity in the perigenual anterior cingulate cortex (pACC), relative to social comparisons between the self and dissimilar others or between two judgment targets other than the self (Moore, Merchant, Kahn, & Pfeifer, 2013). An aspect of vmPFC anterior and inferior to the pACC has been routinely implicated in the computation of value and affective meaning, and it has been recently demonstrated that this value signal is ‘person invariant,’ meaning that the value signal in vmPFC scales with a calculation of subjective value of rewards regardless of their intended recipient. Thus, we would not expect to identify meaningful differences in the vmPFC responses across disclosure conditions after controlling for PSE. However, given its role in comparative social judgement, it seems likely that pACC is differentially sensitive to different sorts of self disclosure.  

**Hypothesis 2: vS and pACC responses will differ across disclosure conditions but vmPFC responses will not (after weighting for PSE). This would suggest that reward signal from vS is weighted by activity in pACC that is sensitive to social context in order to compute the ultimate subjective value across disclosure types.**  

In order to functionally localize activity associated with self-relevant cognition, we intend to employ an additional fMRI paradigm (detailed in Figure 2) in which participants are asked to evaluate trait adjectives in terms of their applicability to the self [1] or malleability [2], a contrast that has previously served to elicit clear distinctions between activity associated with self-relevant or abstract, non self-relevant cognition in our laboratory (Jankowski, Moore, Merchant, Kahn, & Pfeifer, 2014).The contrast of self-relevance blocks against malleability blocks should reveal activity in mPFC (to include pACC) and lateral temporal/parietal cortex, while the inverse contrast should reveal activity in lateral prefrontal and medial parietal cortices. Reward-related activity will be likewise localized using the fMRI paradigm described in Figure 3, a probabilistic learning task that allows for per-trial calculation of the expected value and prediction error associated with each decision and its outcome (Cohen et al., 2010). Expected value is expected to track with activity in mPFC, while the prediction error signal is expected to correlate with activity in the vS.
